# 🧠 Deep Learning Notes & Implementations

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Repository**!  
This is where I organize my notes, explanations, and hands-on implementations while learning and experimenting with deep learning concepts.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Build a strong **theoretical foundation** in deep learning  
- Implement neural networks **from scratch** to understand inner workings  
- Use **PyTorch/TensorFlow** for real-world applications  
- Document everything in clear, concise notes  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow/Keras (optional)
- Jupyter Notebooks
